### User Stories

- As a user, I want to find a nearby walker, so that I can book them.
- As a user, I want to connect with the walkers, so that I can exchange more information.
- As a user, I want to change my profile, so that I can show exact information about me.

> This design was planned before on paper, then moved to Figma app for the fine details.
Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack SideLick uses:

- This project uses the [React Native framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) package. With a document data model that maps to how developers think and code and a powerful, unified query API, MongoDB powers faster, more flexible application development.
- The app uses [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/). Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- [Initializing the project](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/)
- Run the command below in your directory, it will create a project named my-app. Select the "blank" template when prompted.

  ```sh
  expo init my-app
  ```
