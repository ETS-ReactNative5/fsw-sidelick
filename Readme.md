> SideLick is a dog walking app, where clients can simply log in and look for nearby walkers, book them, and contact them via WhatsApp.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to find a nearby walker, so that I can book them.
- As a user, I want to connect with the walkers, so that I can exchange more information.
- As a user, I want to change my profile, so that I can show exact information about me.

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack SideLick uses:

- This project uses the [React Native framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) package. With a document data model that maps to how developers think and code and a powerful, unified query API, MongoDB powers faster, more flexible application development.
- The app uses [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/). Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
- The app uses [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/documentation) for image upload. Cloudinary provides a secure and comprehensive API for easily uploading assets from server-side code, directly from the browser or from a mobile application.
