> Hello world! SideLick is a dog walking app, where clients can simply log in and look for nearby walkers, book them, and contact them via WhatsApp.

**[PROJECT PHILOSOPHY](https://github.com/HalaZbib22/SideLick---Frontend-react-native-#project-philosophy) • [WIREFRAMES](https://github.com/HalaZbib22/SideLick---Frontend-react-native-#wireframes) • [TECH STACK](https://github.com/HalaZbib22/SideLick---Frontend-react-native-#tech-stack) • [IMPLEMENTATION](https://github.com/HalaZbib22/SideLick---Frontend-react-native-#-impplementation) • [HOW TO RUN?](https://github.com/HalaZbib22/SideLick---Frontend-react-native-#how-to-run)**

> This design was planned before on paper, then moved to Figma app for the fine details.
Note that i didn't use any styling library or theme, all from scratch and using pure css modules

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack SideLick uses:

- This project uses the [React Native framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) package. With a document data model that maps to how developers think and code and a powerful, unified query API, MongoDB powers faster, more flexible application development.
- The app uses [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/). Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.
